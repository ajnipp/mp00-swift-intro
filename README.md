# Introduction to Swift
For this project, you'll be writing a few basic Swift functions (and a `struct`) to get a taste of Swift syntax. None of the functions are especially complex, but you should probably work on the simplest ones first. Here's the recommended order of completion: 

1. greet
2. square
3. everyOtherSum
4. describeError
5. addFive
6. Car

Each of these has at least one test written for it on GitHub Classroom. The tests use output, so **make sure you are only printing what the `test()` method would expect.**

Be sure to commit + push your code every time you reach a good checkpoint.
